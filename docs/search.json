Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are another framework, originally introduced by Wright (1921), but subsequently significantly generalized and extended by Spirtes et al. (1993), Pearl (1995), and Dawid (2002), among others.\nWe will first present a simple approach to unifying these two approaches via Single-World Intervention Graphs (SWIGs). The SWIG encodes the counterfactual independences associated with a specific hypothetical intervention on a set of treatment variables. The nodes on the SWIG are the corresponding counterfactual random variables. This represents a counterfactual model originally introduced by Robins (1986) using event trees, known as Finest Fully Randomized Causally Interpretable Structured Tree Graphs (FFRCISTG).\nWe will use this synthesis, to describe the potential outcome (po) calculus, introduced by Malinsky et al. (2019). These rules are similar to, but simpler than, the do-calculus of Pearl (1995) and clarify the underlying concepts involved. We will outline a complete algorithm for deriving identifying expressions for counterfactual causal queries.\nBy expanding the graph, SWIGs may also be used to describe a novel interventionist approach to mediation analysis whereby treatment is decomposed into multiple separable components. This provides a means of discussing direct effects without reference to “cross-world” independence assumptions, nested counterfactuals or interventions on the mediator. The theory preserves the dictum “no causation without manipulation” and makes questions of mediation empirically testable in future randomized controlled trials.\nThis is joint work with James M. Robins (Harvard) and Ilya Shpitser (Johns Hopkins)."

    "text": "Introduction to Causal Inference, by Rhian Daniel (Cardiff University) and Erin Gabriel (University of Copenhagen)\nLocation: TBD Start time: 9:00 with a coffee break End time: 12:00\nThis course (which had its first incarnation at the UK-CIM 2016) is a whistlestop tour of the concepts and methods of causal inference, aimed at an audience of newcomers to the area, but who have a working knowledge of topics such as regression models. The emphasis is on giving enough background on the basic ideas so that the Euro-CIM meeting can be enjoyed without feeling lost. The material covered might therefore change slightly once the final programme for the meeting is known, but is likely to include:\n\nthe different languages of causality, e.g. do-notation, potential outcomes\nhow these languages express causal effects\nthe sorts of assumptions often relied upon to identify causal effects, and the meaning of identification\ngraphical models used in causal inference, including DAGs and SWIGs\nregression models as causal models\nmethods based on the propensity score\n\nThe fact that the list above is far too long for a half-day course gives an impression of the nature of the workshop - rather than dwell on all the intricacies of the various methods and approaches, and how one might apply them in practice using computer packages, the focus will instead be on imparting the main ideas before moving swiftly on to the next topic."
