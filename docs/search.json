    "text": "Introduction to Causal Inference, by Rhian Daniel (Cardiff University) and Erin Gabriel (University of Copenhagen)\nLocation: TBD Start time: 9:00 with a coffee break End time: 12:00\nThis course (which had its first incarnation at the UK-CIM 2016) is a whistlestop tour of the concepts and methods of causal inference, aimed at an audience of newcomers to the area, but who have a working knowledge of topics such as regression models. The emphasis is on giving enough background on the basic ideas so that the Euro-CIM meeting can be enjoyed without feeling lost. The material covered might therefore change slightly once the final programme for the meeting is known, but is likely to include:\n\nthe different languages of causality, e.g. do-notation, potential outcomes\nhow these languages express causal effects\nthe sorts of assumptions often relied upon to identify causal effects, and the meaning of identification\ngraphical models used in causal inference, including DAGs and SWIGs\nregression models as causal models\nmethods based on the propensity score\n\nThe fact that the list above is far too long for a half-day course gives an impression of the nature of the workshop - rather than dwell on all the intricacies of the various methods and approaches, and how one might apply them in practice using computer packages, the focus will instead be on imparting the main ideas before moving swiftly on to the next topic."
